        "You want to start with something simple and general, so you plan to make it open domain, using Wikipedia as a corpus for answering questions. You want to use the best NLP that your compute resources allow (you're lucky enough to have access to a GPU), so you're going to focus on the big, flashy Transformer models that are all the rage these days.\n",

        "Sounds like you're building an IR-based QA system. In our previous post ([Intro to Automated Question Answering](https://qa.fastforwardlabs.com/methods/background/2020/04/28/Intro-to-QA.html)), we covered the general design of these systems, which typically require two main components: the document _retriever_ (a search engine) that selects the n most relevant documents from a large collection, and a document _reader_ that processes these candidate documents in search of an explicit answer span. \n",

        "A virtual environment is always best practice and we're using `venv` on our workhorse machine. For this project, we'll be using PyTorch, which handles the heavy lifting of deep differentiable learning. If you have a GPU you'll want a PyTorch build that includes CUDA support, though most cells in this notebook will work fine without one. Check out [PyTorch's quick install guide](https://pytorch.org/) to determine the best build for your GPU and OS. We'll also be using the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html) library, which provides easy-to-use implementations of all the popular Transformer architectures, like BERT. Finally, we'll need the [wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) library for easy access and parsing of Wikipedia pages."
